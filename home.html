    <h4 class="w3-center"><em>About 1 in 4 people in the United States alone struggle with their mental health, yet only about half of these people seek help. Speaking about mental health is quite taboo in society, which facilitates a negative stigma surrounding the issue. The goal of this website is to raise awareness for, as well as teach about, the struggles that people grappling with their mental health face, in an attempt to start conversations about the topic. It is our hope to destigmatize the issue of mental health by giving people enough information to be able to talk about the topic, and thus normalize the act of seeking help.
