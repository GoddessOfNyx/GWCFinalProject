<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">SIGNS/SYMPTOMS</h3>
  <p>Many symptoms of depression occur naturally in everyone. One red flag that someone has depression is if these type of symptoms last for more than two wees. Remember, everyone is different, symptoms are different for everyone.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The individual may feel persistant sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessnesss, guilt, anxiety, or emptyness/feeling "empty".</li>
    <br>
    <li>They may have persistant irritabilty, causing changes in social interactions.</li>
    <br>
    <li>They may have a loss of appetite, leading to fluctuations or drastic changes in weight.</li>
    <br>
    <li>They may also have a loss of interest in either hobbies or general activities.</li>
    <br>
    <li>They may struggle to concentrate, including feeling restless and unable to make proper decisions.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Many times, the individial can have physical issues, sometimes based upon lack of sleep or appetite, but sometimes it can just..happen. That includes aches, headaches, cramps, being unable to eat well.</li>
    <br>
    <li>In more extreme situations, the individal may feel suicidal. They can either think about it or attempt to.</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
  <p>Always remember, it's different for everyone. Someone might have more severe symptoms than others. Also note that there are different types of depression. For example, it's normal to feel depressed when a family member has passed away, but that's different than having a mental illness.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Also note, there are different kinds of depression.</p>

   <!--How to Help-->
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="about">
  <h3 class="w3-center">HOW TO HELP</h3>
  <p>There are many different ways to treat depression. Just like with the signs and symptoms, treatment is different for everyone. Here are some examples of ways depression can be treated. It may seems scary, some may seem extreme, and in some cases they are. This isn't to scare, it's to inform that it is a problem, not just a mindset.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Many times, depression can be treated simply. Being able to take up a hobby, exercising, arts such as painting/drawing or music, or skills such as computer programming. Playing games, interacting with people, as well as traveling and trying new things</li>
    <br>
    <li> Many times, therapy is a necessary approach. Although there is a negative connotation to "therapy" and seeing a therapist, it is actually recommended in many articles, including from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-moore/everyone-should-be-in-the_b_693124.html">the Huffington post</a> as well as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/06/03/11-intriguing-reasons-to-give-talk-therapy-a-try/#3816c3da4ebb">Forbes magazine</a> that everyone can and should take some time to participate in it. There is no shame in talking out your problems or your passions with someone who is there to help you.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Medication: Sometimes, medication is necessary to help treat depression. Due to the fact that everyone experiences it differently, different medications work for everyone, and they each have different side affects. This is something usually discussed with a therapist and a doctor, to see if the individual really needs it or not. The patient is a human, and they have to deal with it, so it's important to remember what the patient is comfortable with. 
    <br>
    -> Many times, you take the medication a few times a week, to work or to help tame the symptoms. After a period of months, safely, the individual can take less if they have improved. It's unsafe to stop taking the antidepressants immediatly all at once.
    <br>
    -> Many times, young adults and children experience an increase in certain thoughts like suicide. This is due to the affects many of the medications provide. If they attempt to increase motivation and energy through providing dopamine and epinephrine, that energy might go towards their thoughts of suicide. When using medication, it's important to be aware of this and to take care of the individual.
